  <p>Château La Bourguette traces back to the Roman times. During that period, grapes were grown in the areas that Château La Bourguette currently is situated on to make wine. In the 17th Century, the region was occupied by the English and formed part of the Guyenne area. Château La Bourguette formally came into existence then.
Château La Bourguette was known for its wine while being the hunting lodge of the Duke of Richmond. During that oxcart period, people would come to Château La Bourguette to trade Dutch hearth-plates for barrels of wine. Some of these plates can still be seen in the fireplaces there.
The total area of Château La Bourguette is 29 hectares, of which 19 hectares are planted with vines on well-oriented clay and limestone hillsides. It has choice grape varieties in well proportions that include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc for the reds.</p>

  <h2>The Wine Making Process</h2>
</div>
<section class='timeline-section'>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Harvesting</time>The first step is harvesting of the grapes. The time in the season at which the grapes are picked determines the sweetness, flavour and acidity of the wine.
        Harvesting can be done by hand or using machines. At Chateau La Bourguette, we pick all of our grapes by hand, which helps to retain the sweetness of the grape. Once picked, the grapes are sorted in bunches. Under-ripe and rotten grapes are removed.

      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Crushing</time>The grapes are then de-stemmed and crushed. In the past, the crushing process was done by feet and if you come visit, you will have the opportunity to crush our grapes by feet. The majority of the grapes however, are crushed mechanically. When making red wine, the seeds, solids and skins are kept
        in contact with the juice to release additional tannins, flavour and colour.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Fermentation</time>Yeast is added to the wine to transform the sugar from the grapes into alcohol. The total process can take from a week to a month
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Clarification</time>Clarification is the process where tannins, proteins and dead yeast is removed from the wine. The wine is transferred into stainless steel or oak barrels. Substances are added to which unwanted prticles will stick to
        and cause them to sink to the bottom of the barrel. The wine is also filtered to remove larger particles.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Aging and Bottling</time>The wine is transferred to oak barrels and left for a predetermined time for aging. Once the aging process finishes, the wine is bottled and capped.
